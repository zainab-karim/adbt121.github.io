      <center><p> I am 19 years old and a new student studying Computer Science at City University. Despite being uncertain on the years to come, I am eager to learn more, gain more experiences and hopeful on what the future has in store.

      I have coded in a python, java, c#, html and css in a beginner level in my previous academic years. Those years included making basic level games, programs and websites. Other than coding, my time is spent a balance between being outdoors in nature, playing golf and other activities and staying in with my friends and family. I also enjoy getting in touch with my creative side by drawing and painting.
