     <center><h3>Zainab Karim</h3>
      <center><p> I am 19 years old and a new student studying Computer Science at City University. Despite being uncertain on the years to come, I am eager to learn more, gain more experiences and hopeful on what the future has in store.

      I have coded in a python, java, c#, html and css in a beginner level in my previous academic years. Those years included making basic level games, programs and websites. Other than coding, my time is spent a balance between being outdoors in nature, playing golf and other activities and staying in with my friends and family. I also enjoy getting in touch with my creative side by drawing and painting.

    <center><h3>Bootcamp 2020: Bubble Popper</h3></center>
    <center> <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City 2020. This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of loops, if statements, user interactivity and audio files. I created a bubble pop game in which the main objective is to tap as many bubbles as you can in under 30 seconds. Every time a bubble is pressed, another bubble will appear on the screen in a random location and size. The users score will increase by one every time they score a point. At the end of the coundown, the users score will be displayed in a game over screen.
